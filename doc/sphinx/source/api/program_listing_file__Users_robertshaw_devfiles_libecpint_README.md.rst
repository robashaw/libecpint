   Libecpint is a C++ library for the efficient evaluation of integrals over ab initio effective core potentials, using a mixture of generated, recursive code and Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature. It is designed to be standalone and generic, and is now in its first stable release. If you experience any problems please raise an issue here; contributions and suggestions are also welcome.
   
   ## New in first full release
   
   - Analytical 1st and 2nd derivatives;
   - Integration now >10x faster;
   - New, high level API, with ECP library;
   - Automated testing suite.
   
   ### Patch 1
   
   - Bug fix in screening of on-ECP type 2 integrals
   - Improvements in CMake build steps, thanks to nabbelbabbel/moritzBens
   
   ### Patch 2
   
   - Fix for memory leaks in derivative routines
   - Minor changes to CMake files
   
   ## Dependencies
   
   - A modern C++ compiler, at least C++11 standard library is required. This has been tested with:
     * gcc (v6.3.0 and above)
     * clang (v10.0.0 and above), you may need the CXX flag "-std=c++14"
     * icpc (v20.2.1), may also need the CXX flag "-std=c++14"
   - CMake/CTest build tools (v3.12 and higher)
   - Python (2.7 or above, including 3 and higher)
   
   Additionally, if you wish to regenerate the radial code (see below),  Python >=3.6 is required with numpy and sympy.
