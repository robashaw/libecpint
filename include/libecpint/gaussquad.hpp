	* \brief Performs adaptive Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature of the second kind for any given function.
	* 
	* Stores the weights and abscissae for the quadrature, and provides two different methods to integrate on [-1, 1] 
	* Also contains means to transform the region of integration to [0, infinity) and [rmin, rmax]
